WPF-Login allows a user to create a custom login page, or insert the default login form into the currently activated theme.

== Description ==

The WP FLogin allows a user to create a custom login page, or insert the default login form into the currently activated theme.
It includes the ability to upload a custom logo, change the colors, disable elements, and it contains a theme editor specifically for the login form.
This theme editor gives maximum control over the login form while still maintaining the default WordPress functionality such as login validation.
If you tried to use wp-login by Websitez.com you should upgrade to wpf-login that fixes all the issues of the previous plugin.
